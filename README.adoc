= Automated Relax-and-Recover testing

The purpose of this project is to create Ansible playbooks to perform
automated backup and restore tests for different Linux distributions.

Three different sets of playbooks are considered:

 - Playbooks to create Linux images
 - Playbooks to set up infrastructure (e.g. NFS server, rsync server)
 - Playbooks to test specific backup and restore methods

At the moment this project only includes the build of a minimal CentOS 7
VM image, to be used as the basis for the other 2 playbooks.

More to come...
